# Resources and credits

## Tools this project is built on

- [decomp-toolkit](https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit) — analysis, splitting, REL and disc tooling (encounter).
- [objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff) — object diffing and progress reports; powers [decomp.dev](https://decomp.dev).
- [wibo](https://github.com/decompals/wibo) — runs the CodeWarrior compilers on Linux and macOS.
- [dtk-template](https://github.com/encounter/dtk-template) — the project structure, `configure.py` and build system (CC0).
- [sjiswrap](https://github.com/encounter/sjiswrap) — Shift-JIS source wrapper (JPN builds).

## `line__.bin`

- [Line__Crypt](https://github.com/CosmoCortney/Line__Crypt) by CosmoCortney — documented the cipher over `enemy_line/line__.bin` and its per-region keys. `tools/linecrypt.py` is a reimplementation of the 32-bit LCG XOR stream, cross-checked against the retail loader stub's disassembly.
- [SMB_LZ_Tool](https://github.com/bobjrsenior/SMB_LZ_Tool) by bobjrsenior (Unlicense) — the Amusement Vision FF7-style LZSS shared with Super Monkey Ball. `tools/avlz.py` reimplements the decoder to mirror the retail routine.

## Reference decompilations

- [doldecomp/dolsdk2001](https://github.com/doldecomp/dolsdk2001) — Dolphin SDK; preferred reference for SDK units in main.dol.
- [doldecomp/melee](https://github.com/doldecomp/melee), [doldecomp/sms](https://github.com/doldecomp/sms), [doldecomp/mkdd](https://github.com/doldecomp/mkdd) — MSL, MetroTRK and middleware references.
- [camthesaxman/smb-decomp](https://github.com/camthesaxman/smb-decomp) — the closest engine relative (Amusement Vision). Read for vocabulary only: no licence, nothing copied.

### Dolphin SDK source adaptation

The CARD, OS, EXI and SI implementations and Dolphin declarations are adapted from the CC0
[MKDD](https://github.com/SwareJonge/mkdd) and
[TWW](https://github.com/zeldaret/tww) SDK sources. Exact upstream files,
revisions, function identities and relocation bindings are recorded in
[`state/sdkimports/card.json`](../state/sdkimports/card.json),
[`os.json`](../state/sdkimports/os.json), [`exi.json`](../state/sdkimports/exi.json)
and [`si.json`](../state/sdkimports/si.json). The complete
`CARDCheck.c`, `CARDCreate.c`, `CARDNet.c` and `CARDRdwr.c` files use MKDD;
`CARDOpen.c` uses TWW. `OSAudioSystem.c` is consolidated from MKDD. All build includes belong to this repository under
`include/dolphin/`; upstream checkouts are only inputs to the import tool.

### Sofdec source adaptation

The Sofdec C and shared types are adapted from the CC0
[MK Deception decompilation](https://github.com/ShulkMaster/mk-deception), revision
`7f36c3c64be9e2c40ea7301fe6c150d585b1a97d`. Function identities and relocation bindings
are recorded in [`state/sdkimports/sofdec.json`](../state/sdkimports/sofdec.json).
`mpvabdec.c` is a complete translation unit. The build uses owned sources and headers
under `src/rel/movie_module/` and `include/sofdec/`.
